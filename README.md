# I am Yarin Vasker
I am an 18 years old computer science student on my final year. I am passionate about computers and problem solving.

## Projects I have made
I am most proud of:
- [SnakeAI](https://github.com/yarinvasket/SnakeAI-Forms) - Watch an AI learning to play snake without any prior training or programming. I have developed this project in 2020 after self-studying fundamental machine learning algorithms. I applied my knowledge to create this projcet from scratch, without using any machine learning libraries.
- Myoud - Myoud is an end-to-end encrypted cloud and web application, where users can share files with each other without anyone else able to inspect it. During its development, I learned a lot about cryptography, web security and software design practices. Read more about it [here](TO BE FILLED).
  - [Myoud's client](https://github.com/yarinvasket/myoud-client) - developed using Node, Electron and TypeScript, the client is where all of the cryptography happens so that files can be uploaded and shared securely.
  - [Myoud's server](https://github.com/yarinvasket/myoud-server) - developed using python and flask, the server is responsible for users' account security and keeping the encrypted files safe.
